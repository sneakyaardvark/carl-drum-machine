Number of sensors
 - 8 buttons for beat, each with 2 LEDs
 - Function buttons, play has 1 LED

Power supply
 - multiple regulators: 5V and 3.3V
 - multiple of each for temperature management
 - calculate power consumption
 - Use diodes for feedback / reverse polarity
 - 100uF or less caps close to ICs (decoupling caps)
 - USBC for power?
 - 0.5 for power traces
 - 0.3 for everything else

LED driver
 - 1 resistor controls voltage to all LEDs

Use different switch for power toggle (keyboard switch won't work)
